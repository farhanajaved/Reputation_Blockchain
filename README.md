# Blockchain-Based Reputation Model

This repository contains a smart contract for a blockchain-based reputation model, designed to run on the Ethereum network. The ReputationModel contract is intended to manage and calculate the reputation scores of registered clients based on the weights they submit. This model can be integrated into various decentralized applications (dApps) that require a trust mechanism for their participants.

## Features

- **Client Registration**: Users can register as clients, which is a prerequisite for participating in the reputation system.
- **Weight Submission**: Registered clients can submit their model weights, which contribute to their reputation score.
- **Reputation Calculation**: The contract calculates reputation scores based on submitted weights and historical data, using a custom algorithm that can incorporate dynamic metrics and a decay factor over time.
- **Round Management**: The contract operates in rounds, with each round allowing for the submission of weights and the updating of reputation scores.
- **Admin Control**: An admin role is defined for oversight and management of the contract's operation.

## Contract Overview

- `ReputationModel.sol`: The main contract that includes all the logic for registering clients, submitting weights, calculating reputation scores, and managing rounds.

## How It Works

1. **Initialization**: An instance of the ReputationModel contract is deployed to the Ethereum network with a specified number of rounds.
2. **Registration**: Users call `registerClient` to register themselves in the reputation model.
3. **Weight Submission**: Registered users submit their model weights through the `submitModelWeights` function.
4. **Reputation Score**: The contract calculates and updates the reputation score for each user after each weight submission.
5. **Rounds**: The contract operates in multiple rounds, and users can update their weights in each round to influence their reputation score.

## Setup and Deployment

Prerequisites:
- Node.js and npm
- Truffle or Hardhat
- Ethereum wallet with testnet or mainnet ETH

Deployment Steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using npm.
3. Compile the contract with Truffle or Hardhat.
4. Deploy the contract to your chosen network (testnet/mainnet).

## Usage

To interact with the deployed ReputationModel contract, you can use web3.js, ethers.js, or other Ethereum client libraries. Example interactions are provided in the `scripts/` directory.
